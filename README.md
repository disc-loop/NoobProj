# NoobProj
A project for noobs

Last time:
- We played around with C++
- Tried to create a Board object with a constructor that initialised an array but this didn't really work out all that well
- Started using structs for everything

Next time:
- Have a read of Prag Prog, and maybe see if theres any good C++ books
- Do some katas
- Figure out the C++ way of creating this
